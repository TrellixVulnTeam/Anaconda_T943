# Image Classifier

This is an example application that classifies an image using a pre-trained
TensorFlow model (Inception trained on the ImageNet 2012 Challenge data set)
based on an uploaded image.

## Tasks

* Deploy image classifier application
* Examine the contents of `classify_image.py` (classifier) and `main.py` (UI)
* Review the dependencies in `anaconda-project.yml`
* Upload a sample image to the classifier
* Try to fool the classifier by searching for and uploading other images (Note:
  Use images in PNG, JPG, or GIF format)
