  summary: File-based time-series database format for Graphite
  description: |
    Whisper is a fixed-size database, similar in design and purpose to RRD
    (round-robin-database). It provides fast, reliable storage of numeric data
    over time. Whisper allows for higher resolution (seconds per point) of
    recent data to degrade into lower resolutions for long-term retention of
    historical data.
