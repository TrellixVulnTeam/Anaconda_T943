    # The following is needed to make sure that the package works as a GUI
    # application (glue needs to be run with python.app, not python)
    - python.app     [osx]

    # Temporary: the scikit-image conda package is missing the dask dependency
    # so we add it here for now, otherwise we run into issues with
    # pkg_resources
    - dask

# NOTE: we deliberatey do NOT include an app entry here, because we
# instead do this in the glueviz meta-package (we don't want glue to
# appear twice in the navigator)

test:
  imports:
    - glue
    - glue.core
    - glue.app.qt           [not win]
  commands:
    - glue --version
