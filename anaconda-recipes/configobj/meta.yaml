  summary: Config file reading, writing and validation
  description: |
    ConfigObj is a simple but powerful config file reader and writer. Its main
    feature is that it is very easy to use, with a straightforward
    programmer's interface and a simple syntax for config files. It has many
    other useful features, including nested sections, list values, multiple
    line values, string interpolation, and much more.
