  summary: M4 Macros to automatically configure software source code
  description: |
    Autoconf is a tool for producing shell scripts that automatically configure software source code packages to adapt to many kinds of Posix-like systems.
    The configuration scripts produced by Autoconf are independent of Autoconf when they are run, so their users do not need to have Autoconf.
