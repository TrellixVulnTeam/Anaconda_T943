  summary: file system based database that uses Python pickles
  description: |
    PickleShare is a small "shelve" like datastore with concurrency support.
    Like shelve, a PickleShareDB object acts like a normal dictionary. Unlike
    shelve, many processes can access the database simultaneously. Changing a
    value in database is immediately visible to other processes accessing the
    same database.
