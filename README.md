The distribution includes data-science packages suitable for ***Windows***, ***Linux***, and ***macOS***. It is developed and maintained by Anaconda, Inc. As an ***Anaconda, Inc.*** product, it is also known as ***Anaconda Distribution*** or **Anaconda Individual Edition**, while other products from the company are Anaconda Team Edition and ***Anaconda Enterprise Edition***, both of which are not free.

Package versions in ***Anaconda*** are managed by the package management system ***Conda package manager***. This package manager was spun out as a separate open-source package as it ended up being useful on its own and for other things than ***Python distribution***. There is also a small, *bootstrap* version of Anaconda called ***Miniconda***, which includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other packages.
