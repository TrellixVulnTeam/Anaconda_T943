Note: The free space may have fallen below specific size requirements due to reserve space and/or small files placed on the mount after formatting. Confirm that the size is close to the requested size before proceeding.

Note: XFS file system should be formatted with the option ftype=1 in order to support the overlay driver  for docker. In order to fix the issue the file system will need to be recreated and can be done using the following example:
mkfs.xfs -n ftype=1 /path/to/your/device

Module Checks
Enabled:
overlay

Missing:
iptable_filter
br_netfilter
iptable_nat
ebtables

HOW TO
To enable a module you can do the following as root:
modprobe MODULE_NAME

To persist through a reboot do the following as root:
echo -e "MODULE_NAME" > /etc/modules-load.d/MODULE_NAME.conf

COMMANDS
You can use the following commands to enable the appropriate modules that are required.
echo -e "iptable_filter" > /etc/modules-load.d/iptable_filter.conf
echo -e "br_netfilter" > /etc/modules-load.d/br_netfilter.conf
echo -e "iptable_nat" > /etc/modules-load.d/iptable_nat.conf
echo -e "ebtables" > /etc/modules-load.d/ebtables.conf

Module Result: FAIL

---------------------------------------------------------

Sysctl Settings
Enabled/Correct:
net.ipv4.ip_forward

Disabled:
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables

Incorrect:
fs.inotify.max_user_watches = 8192

Skipped:
fs.may_detach_mounts

HOW TO
To enable a setting you can do the following as root:
sysctl -w SYSCTL_SETTING=1

To persist through a reboot do the following as root:
echo -e "SYSCTL_SETTING = 1" >> /etc/sysctl.d/10-SYSCTL_SETTING.conf"

COMMANDS
You can use the following commands to enable the appropriate settings that are required.
echo -e "fs.inotify.max_user_watches = 1048576" >> /etc/sysctl.d/10-fs.inotify.max_user_watches.conf
echo -e "net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1" >> /etc/sysctl.d/10-net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables.conf
echo -e "net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1" >> /etc/sysctl.d/10-net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables.conf

Sysctl Result: FAIL

---------------------------------------------------------

Directory Checks

Found directories:
/etc/chef
/etc/salt
/etc/puppet

Directory Result: WARN

Note: The directory check is looking for directories created or left over from processes, config management, and other services that have been found to cause issues with AE5.

---------------------------------------------------------

NTP Checks
Using:        None
Installed:    ntpd
Enabled:      False
Synchronized: False

NTP Result: FAIL

Note: NTP is vitally important to a system, and will prevent time drift among the servers in the kubernetes cluster. Time drift has been known to cause issues with etcd, and ordered events. It is advisable to install, setup, and sync all servers to a central time server.

---------------------------------------------------------

DNS Checks
Testing domain:      test.tld.com
Resolved IP address: None

Testing domain:      *.test.tld.com
Resolved IP address: None

DNS Result: FAIL

Note: In order for the system to function correctly both a TLD and wildcard DNS entry are required. Both domains would need to resolve to the AE5 master and you can find out more information here: https://enterprise-docs.anaconda.com/en/latest/install/reqs.html?highlight=DNS#reqs-dns.
