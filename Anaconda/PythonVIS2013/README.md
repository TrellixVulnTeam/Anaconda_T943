Before the workshop
-------------
To create a more fluid experience at the tutorial, please download the software listed below before attending.  
Pre-installation will eliminate a major load on the network bandwidth and increase the amount of time we
can spend _using_ the tools to make useful stuff.

* Download and install the [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) python distribution.
Anaconda is a batteries-included Python 2.7 distribution with useful tools to keep different packages from
conflicting with each other.  We will use the Anaconda-included 
[numpy](http://http://www.numpy.org/), 
[MatPlotLib](http://matplotlib.org/)
and [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), and probably other packages to a lesser degree.
* Install [MayaVi](http://mayavi.sourceforge.net/) by running "conda install mayavi" in your terminal.  
* Install [PyQTGraph](http://www.pyqtgraph.org/) by running "pip install pyqtgraph" in your terminal.
* Install [Vincent](https://github.com/wrobstory/vincent) by cloning the github repo.
* Install [Bokeh](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/Bokeh) by cloning the gibhub repo.
