Getting Started
===============

Revision Control
----------------

Hexrd uses the git revision control system and `GitHub
<https://github.com/praxes/hexrd>`_. If you are not familiar with git, github
provides an `interactive online tutorial <https://try.github.io>`_. The free,
online `Pro Git <https://progit.org>`_ book is another good reference.

To install git, Linux users should use their package manager. OS X users may
want to install `GitHub for Mac <https://mac.github.com>`_. Windows users may
want to install `GitHub for Windows <https://windows.github.com>`_.

The next step is to clone the repository. At the command line, run::

  git clone -o hexrd https://github.com/praxes/hexrd.git

That creates the project directory. Move into that directory::

  cd hexrd

Develop Mode
------------

The following command will allow python to run hexrd from the project
directory (assuming numpy and setuptools are already installed)::

  python setup.py develop

That will build the extension modules, create and install the executable, but
you can still edit python files in the project directory and the changes will
be immediately available without having to reinstall. However, any time the
extension module sources are changed, you must run the above command again to
recompile the extensions.

To stop using develop mode::

  python setup.py develop --uninstall

We provide a `hexrd.debug` function that lets you interact with the code in IPython.
Be advised, this should always be called using `hexrd.debug()`, rather than
`from hexrd import debug` followed by `debug()`, especially when debugging while running
the GUI.

Git Branches
------------

Before you make any changes to the project, make sure your clone is up to
date::

  git checkout master
  git pull

The master branch should be treated as an integration branch, changes aren't
made directly to master. The next step is to make a branch in which to make
modifications::

  git checkout -b my-new-branch

Now, hack away, make commits.

Filing a Pull Request
---------------------

When you think things are ready to be merged, push the branch to your personal
fork of the hexrd repository at GitHub. If you don't already have a fork, visit
the `hexrd project page <https://github.com/praxes/hexrd>`_, and click the
"fork" button in the upper right hand corner of the page (requires a free
GitHub account). When the fork is finished, run the following at the command
line::

  git remote add your_github_id https://github.com/your_github_id/hexrd.git

Now you are ready to push your branch to GitHub::

  git push your_github_id my-new-branch:my-new-branch

The last step is to file a pull request. Browse to your fork at GitHub, select
the `branch: master` button on the left side of the screen, and select
`my-new-branch`. Then select the green "compare, review, create a pull request"
button, add a little information about the changes in the branch, and submit.

Additional Comments
-------------------

If you forgot to create a new branch, and have been making changes directly in
your master branch, there is potential for a more difficult merge. You
generally want the master branch in your local repository to be either in sync
with, or behind, the upstream master branch. You don't want commits in your
local master branch that don't exist in the upstream master. If you find
yourself in such a situation, its easy to resolve. If you have uncommitted
changes in your working directory, first run::

  git stash

Next, create a new branch, which will be a copy of master::

  git checkout -b my-next-branch

Now reset the master branch so it is identical to the upstream master branch::

  git branch -D master
  git checkout -b master -t hexrd/master

Finally, if you stashed any uncommitted changes to create the new branch::

  git checkout my-next-branch
  git stash pop

Now your `my-next-branch` looks just like it would have if you had create the
branch before making any changes to `master`, and `master` is in sync with
https://github.com/praxes/hexrd/tree/master.
