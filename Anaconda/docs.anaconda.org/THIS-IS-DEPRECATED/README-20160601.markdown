## DEPRECATED

This repository is now deprecated; docs are now in a root level directory "docs" in the private repo https://github.com/Anaconda-Platform/anaconda-server/ , so that new code and new docs for each new release can live in the same branch and be merged in a single operation. The change was made in https://github.com/Anaconda-Platform/anaconda-server/pull/1837 .

This repository is preserved so its issues and pull requests can be preserved. If you wish to suggest changes to the documentation and do not have access to the private repository, please file an issue at https://github.com/Anaconda-Platform/support/issues .
